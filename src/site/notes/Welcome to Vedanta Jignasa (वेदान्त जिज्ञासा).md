श्री गुरुभ्यो नमः

शंकरं शंकराचार्य केशवं बादरायणम्। 
सूत्र भाष्य कृतौ वन्दे भगवन्तौ पुनः पुनः ॥

सदा शिव समारंभं शंकराचार्य मध्यमम्॥
अस्मद् परार्च्यन्तां वन्दे गुरु परंपराम्॥ 


In this journal let us learn about basic concepts of Vedanta philosophy

**Advaita Vedanta** is a prominent school of Hindu philosophy that emphasizes the non-dualistic nature of reality. Its core tenet is the identity of the individual soul ( #Atma) with the universal consciousness ( #Brahma)

Advaita Vedanta is  associated with the Indian philosopher Adi #Shankaraacharya, who is credited with systematizing its teachings. It has had a profound influence on Indian thought and spirituality and continues to be studied and practiced today.

In this journal we will study different works by great scholars like Adi #Shankaraacharya (शंकराचार्य), sage #Vidyaranya  (विद्यायरण्य) and many more
