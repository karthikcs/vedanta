## Introduction

सर्वतन्त्रस्वतन्त्राय सदात्माद्वैतवेदिने । 
श्रीमते शंकरार्याय वेदान्तगुरवे नमः ॥ १ ॥

Author bows to Sri Adi Shankara

मननार्थं प्रकरणं वासुदेवयतीश्वरैः । 
रचितं विस्तरेणाद्य संग्रहेण प्रकाश्यते ॥ ३ ॥

बालानामुपकाराय मम विज्ञानसिद्धये । 
तत्र श्रीबालगोपालकृष्णः संनिहितो भवेत् ॥ ४ ॥

In this book, the unnamed author says that he is writing a gist of an elaborated book called Mannam - मननम्, written by the sage Vasudeva (वासुदेव). He mentions that he is writing this book for his own better understanding and for the benefits of students who are getting started with #vedanta  (बालनां उपकराय ). The word बाला means child, which is here referred to as not very matured in the  subject of #vedanta
