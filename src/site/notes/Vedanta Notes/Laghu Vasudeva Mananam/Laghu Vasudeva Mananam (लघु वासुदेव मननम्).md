## First Chapter - प्रथम वर्णकम् 

सर्वतन्त्रस्वतन्त्राय सदात्माद्वैतवेदिने । 
श्रीमते शंकरार्याय वेदान्तगुरवे नमः ॥ १ ॥

Author bows to Sri Adi Shankara

मननार्थं प्रकरणं वासुदेवयतीश्वरैः । 
रचितं विस्तरेणाद्य संग्रहेण प्रकाश्यते ॥ ३ ॥

बालानामुपकाराय मम विज्ञानसिद्धये । 
तत्र श्रीबालगोपालकृष्णः संनिहितो भवेत् ॥ ४ ॥

In this book, the unnamed author says that he is writing a gist of an elaborated book called Mannam - मननम्, written by sage Vasudeva (वासुदेव). He mentions that he is writing this book as his own notes and for the benefits of students who are getting started with #vedanta  (बालनां उपकराय )

Author now talks about 4 main purposes of any human. [[Vedanta Notes/General Terms/4 Fold Purposes of man (चतुर्विध फल पुरुषार्थ)\|4 Fold Purposes of man (चतुर्विध फल पुरुषार्थ)]]

These are 4 Fold purposes of life. Dharma (Virtuous Deeds), Artha (Acquisition of wealth), Kaama (Desires of children/ spouse/ and other earthly pleasures), Moksha (Liberation from संसार - cycle of life and birth). It is important to highlight that the last one मोक्ष - Liberation is the (परमम् ) greatest of all. The reason is Moksha is नित्यम्. Nityam means, permanent - it does not have boundary of time, it is beyond the time. It means it does not have birth nor the destruction (अनादि  and अनंतम् ). Other 3 purposes are not नित्यम् hence not great. 

Here one might have a doubt, how come धर्म - Virtuous deeds is not as great as मोक्ष  (Liberation). Virtuous deeds accumulate पुण्यम् (Punyam). The Punyam leads the जीवात्मा (all of us) to better लोक (worlds). However, it is not permanent. As per the श्रुति ( #veda) once the Punya is reduced, the jeeva should come back to this loka. Hence Dharma is also not permanent.

>तद्यथेह  कर्मचितो  लोकः क्षीयत एवमेवामुत्र पुण्यचितो  लोकः क्षीयते (छा० ८. १. ६.)
>It is very evident that the wealth collected in this world is temporary and keep reducing with time and situation. In the same manner the different worlds attained with acquired punya is also temporary, once punya is reduced we are back to this world 

One last point on this subject, author mentions that मोक्ष - Liberation is attained only by understanding the true #Brahma
