## First Chapter - प्रथम वर्णकम् 

सर्वतन्त्रस्वतन्त्राय सदात्माद्वैतवेदिने । 
श्रीमते शंकरार्याय वेदान्तगुरवे नमः ॥ १ ॥

Author bows to Sri Adi Shankara

मननार्थं प्रकरणं वासुदेवयतीश्वरैः । 
रचितं विस्तरेणाद्य संग्रहेण प्रकाश्यते ॥ ३ ॥

बालानामुपकाराय मम विज्ञानसिद्धये । 
तत्र श्रीबालगोपालकृष्णः संनिहितो भवेत् ॥ ४ ॥

In this book, the unnamed author says that he is writing a gist of an elaborated book called Mannam - मननम्, written by the sage Vasudeva (वासुदेव). He mentions that he is writing this book for his own better understanding and for the benefits of students who are getting started with #vedanta  (बालनां उपकराय ). The word बाला means child, which is here referred to as not very matured in the  subject of #vedanta

Author now talks about 4 main purposes of any human. [[Vedanta Notes/General Terms/4 Fold Purposes of man (चतुर्विध फल पुरुषार्थ)\|4 Fold Purposes of man (चतुर्विध फल पुरुषार्थ)]]

These are 4 Fold purposes of life. Dharma (Virtuous Deeds), Artha (Acquisition of wealth), Kaama (Earthly pleasures), Moksha (Liberation from संसार - cycle of life and birth). It is important to highlight that the last one मोक्ष - Liberation is the greatest (परमम् ) of all. The reason the Moksha is the highest and greatest of all 4 is, that it is Nityam (नित्यम्). Nityam means, permanent - it does not have boundary of time, it is beyond the time. It means it does not have start nor the end (अनादि  and अनंतम् ). Other 3 purposes are not नित्यम् hence not the greatest. 

It is easy to understand Artha and Kaama are not permanent. Wealth reduces with situations or time and so the earthly pleasures. 

One might have doubt, how come धर्म - Virtuous deed is not as great as मोक्ष  (Liberation). Virtuous deeds accumulate Punyam (पुण्यम्). The Punyam leads all of us (जीवात्मा) to the better world (लोक). However, it is not permanent. As per the #veda #upanishad (श्रुति) as the Punya is reduced, the jeeva should come back to this world. Hence Dharma is also not permanent. 

>[!tip]- Chandogya Shruti
>तद्यथेह  कर्मचितो  लोकः क्षीयत एवमेवामुत्र पुण्यचितो  लोकः क्षीयते (छा० ८. १. ६.)
>It is very evident that the wealth collected in this world is temporary and keep reducing with time and situation. In the same manner the different worlds attained with acquired punya is also temporary, once punya is reduced we are back to this world 

One last point on this subject, author mentions that मोक्ष - Liberation is attained only by understanding the true #Brahma 

That #Brahma can be known only by the process of Adhyaropa (अध्यारोप) and Apavada (अपवाद ) process. 

- **Adhyaropa** refers to the process of superimposition or attribution of qualities that do not inherently belong to something.
- **Apavada** refers to the process of negation or exclusion, removing something that was previously superimposed.

This will be more clear with an example. Please see below #Illustration 

| Concept   | Description     | Example                                                                                                                                                               |
| --------- | --------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Adhyaropa | Superimposition | We superimpose the quality of "blueness" on the sky, even though the sky itself has no color. The blueness is due to the interaction of sunlight with the atmosphere. |
| Apavada   | Negation        | Recognizing that the blueness is not inherent to the sky and negating that quality.                                                                                   |

Now let's start with few Superimpositions (अध्यारोप) #Illustration 
* Superimposition of "silver" in a "shell" on a bright sunny day on a beach 
* Superimposition of "serpent" in a "rope" in semi dark condition 
* Superimposition of "man" in a "leaf less old tree" from a distance

Now with proper understanding the superimpositions are negated as below 
* By approaching the Silver looking shell,  one can negate that it is just a shell
* By having more light on the rope, we can negate the false knowledge on serpent in rope
* By having closer look we can understand it's an old tree and not a man

Similarly there is a superimposition of worldly objects (जगत ) in a non-worldly thing (निष्प्रपंच वस्तु ) also known as #Brahma (ब्रह्म) due to the ignorance (अज्ञानम्).  This ignorance is also known as many other words - अविद्या, तमः, मोहः, मूलप्रकृति, प्रधानां as well as माया. This ignorance (मूलप्रकृति) is like a rope made up of white, red and black threads. These threads represent Sattva (सत्त्व), राजस (रजस) and Tamo (तमस) characteritics (गुणाः). The meaning here the ignorance (मूलप्रकृति) comprises of these 3 characteristics.
