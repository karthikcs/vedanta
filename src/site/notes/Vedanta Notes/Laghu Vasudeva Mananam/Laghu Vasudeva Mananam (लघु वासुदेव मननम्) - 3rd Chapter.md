**Question**: How many types of worlds do we have ?

We have only 2 type of world. World of Aatma (आत्मा) and that of Anatma (अनात्मा). But in the previous discussions we have delved and understood that Aatma is nothing to do about this world (जगत्  मिथ्या ). So, how can we say there is a world of Aatma? To clarify this, entire world is made up of conscious and unconscious beings. Since Aatma (आत्मा) is conscious, the world cannot exist without the Self. Therefore, the Self must be said to be within the world

**Question**: What is the difference between **conscious** and **unconscious** beings? 
Everything that moves is conscious, and all that is stationary (immovable) is unconscious.

**Question:**  Now, we have many conscious and unconscious things separately, now how can we say that is of only 2 types
Unconscious is of only one type. Due to the actions and appearance we feel that of many kinds. 
We know Atma is only ONE. Which is Satyam, Jnanam and Anantam [[Vedanta Notes/General Terms/Satyam Jnanam and Anantam - सत्यं, ज्ञानम्, आनंतम्\|Satyam Jnanam and Anantam - सत्यं, ज्ञानम्, आनंतम्]]

Now due to different actions, anaatma is bound to be appearing as different entities, we also feel we have many conscious beings (जीवाः)  and many Ishwaras (ईश्वराः). 

**Question**: But we have heard that we have only one Ishwara. How is it possible?
In different auspicious places and at homes we have different idols to which we worship. But the essence is the same. That's how we should understand this 

**Question**: What is the example for one consciousness(आत्मा) to be shown as multiple entities? 
The earth is only one, but due to the action on it, it looks like many different items such as mountain, tree, tower, river, house, vessels etc, in the same way aatma is one but visible as many entities. This is true for both aatma (Consciousness) as well as Anaatma (non-consciousness) as well. Another famous example would be the akaasha (Space) is the same but still due to the upaadhi (boundary) we feel the space in house and space in vessel are different.
