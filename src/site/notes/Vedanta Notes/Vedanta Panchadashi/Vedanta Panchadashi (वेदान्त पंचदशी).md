   We need to understand that the word #Tattva  in vedanta means the idea of #Brahma. Again the word Brahma is not चतुर्मुख ब्रह्मा  (4 headed God of creation), instead it is supreme knowledge which is omnipresence. The characteristics of Brahma is told in following 3 words 
   * Satyam (सत्यम)
   * Jnaanam (ज्ञानम्)
   * Anantam (anantam)
