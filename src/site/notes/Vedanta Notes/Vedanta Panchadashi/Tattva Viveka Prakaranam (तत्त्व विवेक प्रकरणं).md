>[!tip] Tattva Viveka prakaranam
>Chapter on the Discrimination of Reality

## Shloka 1:

### मङ्गलाचरणम् 


नमः श्रीशङ्करानन्दगुरुपादाम्बुजन्मने । 
सविलासमहामोहग्राहग्रासैककर्मणे ॥ १ ॥

Auspicious invocation. Salutations to the lotus feet of the Guru, Sri Shankara, the embodiment of supreme bliss. He who performs the sole act of devouring the great delusion with all its allurements.


## Shloka 2:

तत्पदाम्बुरुहृद्वन्द्वसेवानिर्मलचेतसाम् । 
सुखबोधाय तत्त्वस्य विवेकोऽयं विधीयते ॥ २ ॥

For those whose minds are purified by the service of the feet of such Guru (as said in previous shloka), the knowledge of discrimination will be told in this book. ॥ 2 ॥

We need to understand few points here 
- A pure mind is prerequisite for the knowledge that's going to be told in this text
- Service of the Guru's feet doesn't necessarily mean physical service by rubbing or touching, instead performing Shravanam, mananam and Nidhidyasanam in the supervision of the Guru. 


## Shloka 3:

### ज्ञानस्य नित्यत्व  निरूपणम् ।

Establishing the fact of permanence and infinity of knowledge.

शब्दस्पर्शादयो वेद्या वैचित्र्याज्जागरे पृथक् । 
ततो विभक्ता तत्संविदैकरूप्यान्न भिद्यते ॥ ३ ॥

Sound, touch, and other objects of knowledge are distinct in wakefulness due to their diversity. But they are not different from the one consciousness that is their essence. ॥ 3 ॥

This verse explains that in the waking state, our perceptions of sound, touch, and other objects appear distinct due to their different qualities. However, the underlying reality is that all these perceptions arise from a single consciousness. This consciousness is the unifying principle behind all diversity.
