>[!tip] Tattva Viveka prakaranam
>Chapter on the Discrimination of Reality


## Shloka 1:

### मङ्गलाचरणम् 


नमः श्रीशङ्करानन्दगुरुपादाम्बुजन्मने । 
सविलासमहामोहग्राहग्रासैककर्मणे ॥ १ ॥

Auspicious invocation. Salutations to the lotus feet of the Guru, Sri Shankara, the embodiment of supreme bliss. He who performs the sole act of devouring the great delusion with all its allurements.


## Shloka 2:

तत्पदाम्बुरुहृद्वन्द्वसेवानिर्मलचेतसाम् । 
सुखबोधाय तत्त्वस्य विवेकोऽयं विधीयते ॥ २ ॥

For those whose minds are purified by the service of the feet of such Guru (as said in previous shloka), the knowledge of discrimination will be told in this book. ॥ 2 ॥

We need to understand few points here 
- A pure mind is prerequisite for the knowledge that's going to be told in this text
- Service of the Guru's feet doesn't necessarily mean physical service by rubbing or touching, instead performing Shravanam, mananam and Nidhidyasanam in the supervision of the Guru. 

The author starts with a doubt

If Brahman (ultimate reality) is defined as **Eternal, One, and the very nature of Knowledge itself**, how do we explain the variety of different thoughts we have in our daily lives?

How can we say Knowledge is unbroken, eternal and only one?

One might wonder how we  "knowing a pot" and "knowing a cloth" are not the multiplicity of knowledge. When we can say "I just gained knowledge" there is a birth of knowledge, so how can it be eternal and unbroken? 

The next few phrases explain that these differences are only due to the external objects and the mental states associated with them, not a change in the underlying Consciousness itself.

**ज्ञानस्य नित्यत्व  निरूपणम् ।**

Establishing the fact of permanence and infinity of knowledge.
## Shloka 3:

शब्दस्पर्शादयो वेद्या वैचित्र्याज्जागरे पृथक् । 
ततो विभक्ता तत्संविदैकरूप्यान्न भिद्यते ॥ ३ ॥

**Focusing wakeful state:**

Sound, touch, and other objects of knowledge are distinct in wakefulness due to their diversity. But they are not different from the one consciousness that is their essence. ॥ 3 ॥

> [!tip]- Avastha traya (अवस्था त्रय) - 3 States of consciousness
**Jagrt (जागृत), Swapna (स्वप्न), and Sushupti (सुषुप्ति)** are terms in #vedanta that refer to the three states of consciousness in human experience, waking state, dream state and deep sleep state.

The text argues that while the things we hear, touch, or see are all different from one another, the **act of knowing** them (Awareness) does not change its nature.

#### 1. The Diversity of the Known (वेद्या)

The text lists the things that are "knowable" and distinct:

- **Sensory Objects:** Sound (_Shabda_), Touch (_Sparsha_), etc. These are the objects of the ears and skin.
    
- **The Instruments:** The senses themselves (ears, skin, etc.) and the elements like Space (_Akasha_) that allow them to function.
    
- **The Difference:** In the waking state, these objects are separate (पृथक्) and different (भिन्न) because they have "different natures" . A sound is not a touch; a pot is not a cloth.

#### 2. The Unity of Consciousness (संविद्)

Despite the variety of objects, the text makes a crucial distinction about the **Awareness** (संविद्) of them:

- **Vibhakta (Detached):** Consciousness is "set apart" from the objects. Even though it reveals the objects, it does not become them.
    
- **Na Bhidyate (Does not divide):** The awareness of a sound is the same "awareness" as the awareness of a touch. The _content_ changes, but the _light_ of awareness remains identical.
    
- **Ekarupyat (Uniformity):** The reason Consciousness is one is its **singular nature**. It does not have parts or different "flavors."

## Shloka 4:

जागरे संविदः एकरूपतां निरूप्य स्वप्नेऽप्यतिदिशति । तथैव ।

Having established the oneness of consciousness in wakefulness, it is also explained in dreams. Similarly...

तथा स्वप्नेऽत्र  वेद्यं तु न स्थिरं जागरे स्थिरम् । 
तदभेदोऽतस्तयोस्संविदेकरूपा न भिद्यते ॥ ४ ॥

Similarly, in dreams, the object of knowledge is not stable, nor is it stable in wakefulness. Therefore, the consciousness that is the essence of both is not different. ॥ 4 ॥

This verse highlights the concept that while the experiences in the dream state and the waking state may seem different in terms of stability, the underlying consciousness that experiences both is the same and undivided. The light of consciousness illuminating the dream-mountain is the same light illuminating the waking-mountain.

## Shloka 5:

अनन्तरं सौषुप्तिकसंविदोऽप्येकत्वविवक्षया आदौ तदस्तित्वं साधयति, सुप्तेति ।

Similarly, even in deep sleep, there is no multiplicity in consciousness, which proves its oneness. The wise ones affirm this in the beginning |

We will now focus on the deep sleep state (सुषुप्ति) and aim to establish that even in this state, consciousness is one and undivided. It starts by asserting the existence of the deep sleep state itself.

सुप्तोत्थितस्य सौषुप्तिकतमो बोधो भवेत् स्मृतिः । 
सा चाऽवबुद्धाविषयाऽवबुद्धं तत्तदा तमः ॥ ५ ॥

Upon waking from deep sleep, the ignorance experienced during deep sleep is remembered. This ignorance is recognized as an object by the awakened mind ॥ 5 ॥

The verse emphasizes the continuity of consciousness and memory across different states of being. Even though one may not be actively aware during deep sleep, upon waking, one can recall that state of deep sleep as a period of ignorance. This recollection is possible because the underlying consciousness remains constant, providing a basis for memory and awareness across different states. Also recollection can not happen if object was not experienced. If we are able to recollect the state deep relaxation, that should have been experienced. The entity that experiences everything is the Consciousness (the witness), which is the same entity in all 3 states.

## Shloka 6 & 7:

स बोधो विषयद्धिन्नो न बोधात्छमप्रघोधवत्‌ | 
एव स्थानत्रयेऽप्येका सवित्तददिनान्तरे || ६ ||

मासाब्दथुगकसपेषु गतागतेष्वनेकधा । 
नोदेति नाऽस्तमेत्येका संविदेषा खयम्प्रभा ॥ ७ ||

**Consciousness vs. Objects** The 6th verse argues that the "light" of awareness is separate from the "things" it illuminates. Just as a physical lamp is different from the table or chair it shines upon. Similarly our consciousness is distinct from the thoughts, images, or physical objects it perceives.

**The Consistency of "Knowing"** Author Sri Vidyaranya points out that the consciousness we have while dreaming is the _same_ consciousness we have while awake. The "scenery" changes (from a dream world to a real bedroom), but the "Knowingness" (बोधा) does not change its nature. It doesn't become "dream-flavored" or "waking-flavored"; it remains pure awareness

**Bridging the Gap of Time** The second half of the verse and 7th verse extends this logic to time
- **The Three States:** In waking, dreaming, and deep sleep, the "knower" is the same.
- **Across Days:** The consciousness you have today is identical in essence to the consciousness you had yesterday and the one you will have tomorrow.

**The conclusion**
The consciousness (संविद्) is non-dual and eternal. While our experiences are fragmented (we wake up, we sleep, months pass), the underlying "Screen of Consciousness" is one continuous, unbroken reality. It concludes that because consciousness never "parts" from itself and doesn't change across states or days, it must be the आत्मा —the eternal Self. Because the nature of आत्मा is the same as nature of consciousness

Till now it has been established that consciousness is the same eternal entity, existed all the time, unbroken in all the 3 states. 



**ज्ञानस्य आत्मत्वपरमानन्दत्वनिरूपणम्** 

The demonstration of Knowledge as the Self (आत्मा) and as Supreme Bliss (आनन्द)

## Shloka 8:

इयमात्मा परानन्दः परप्रेमास्पदं  यतः । 
मा न भूव हि भूयासमिति प्रेमात्मनीक्ष्यते  ॥ ८ ॥

We already know Self (आत्मा) is eternal (नित्यम्). If anything is eternal, that should be the Truth as well. One entity that can achieve this is the consciousness (संविद्), as we have already established that it is eternal in the previous phrase. Due to the fact that it is eternal, it should be Truth as well. Because there is no difference (अभिन्नं) between the characteristics of consciousness (संविद्) and Self (आत्मा), we can prove both are same.

It is proven by the universal, instinctive desire: "May I never cease to be, may I exist forever." This reveals that we love our own existence above all else. This isn't just a casual thought; it is a **universal longing**. Even when a person is suffering, the core "I" wants to continue existing. The text argues that we never wish for our own absolute destruction.

So, why do we want to exist forever?
- We only want things to persist if we **love** them or if they bring us **happiness**.
- Since the desire for self-existence is "unconditional" (we want to exist even when we don't have external possessions), it proves that the **Self is the most beloved thing.**

In Advaita philosophy, **Love (प्रेम)** and **Happiness (आनन्द)** are two sides of the same coin:
- You love something because it is a source of joy.
- If you love your "Self" more than anything else (more than wealth, fame, or even your own body), then the "Self" must be the **highest source of joy (Supreme bliss)**.

## Shloka 9:

 तत्प्रेमर्थमन्यत्र नैवमन्यार्थमात्मनः  ।
अतस्तत्परमं तेन परमानन्द्ताऽत्मनः  ॥ ९॥

This verse provides  the argument that you are the source of supreme happiness. It uses a logic of **unconditional vs. conditional love** to prove that the Self (आत्मा) is the highest bliss

Everything in the world is loved for the sake of the Self, but the Self is loved for its own sake and never for the sake of anything else. Therefore, because the Self is the ultimate and absolute object of love, it is proven to be the nature of Supreme Bliss.

The first half explains why we love external things (money, family, health, objects).

- We do not love a bank account for the paper's sake; we love it for the security or pleasure **it gives us**.
- We love our friends and family because they bring **us** joy or fulfill **our** life.
- Logic: All external love is **instrumental** (a means to an end).

This is the "flip side" of the logic.

- Do you love yourself so that you can get a promotion? No. Even if you lose your job, your health, or your money, the core "I" still wants to exist and be happy.
- The love for the Self is **terminal** (the end goal). It is never a "tool" used to achieve something else.

Because the love for the Self is the only love that doesn't depend on a reason or a benefit, it is called **Paramam** (Supreme/Absolute). We can hence state the self is the one which has highest level of bliss for us.


**ज्ञानस्य परब्रह्माभिन्नत्वनिरूपणं** 
The Demonstration of the identity between Knowledge and Supreme Brahman

## Shloka 10:

इत्थम् सच्चित्परानन्द आत्मा युक्त्या तथाविधम्  |
परं ब्रह्मा तयोश्चैक्यं श्रुत्यन्तेषूपदिष्यते ॥ १०॥

Through logical reasoning, the Self is proven to be of the nature of Existence, Consciousness, and Supreme Bliss (सत् चित् आनन्द). The Upanishads have declared that the Supreme Brahman is of the same nature, concluding that the individual Self and the Absolute Brahman are fundamentally one and the same.

The author is emphasizing that this isn't "blind faith." You don't have to believe in a far-off God to understand this. By simply analyzing your own experience—the fact that you exist, that you are aware, and that you love your own life—you can logically conclude that your true nature is **Existence-Consciousness-Bliss.**

**आत्मनः परमानन्दरूपत्वे  विप्रतिपत्तिमशक्या  परिहरति, अभान  इति**

After establishing the nature of Self as the same as Brahma, we still have doubt if that is true. Because normally we don't recognize it. We always feel sorrow, we are in pain, we feel limited. Then how can we be the same as brahma. In the upcoming verses this doubt will be addressed


## Shloka 11:

अभाने न परं प्रेम, भाने न विषये श्पृहा । 
अतो भानेऽप्यभाताऽसौ परमानन्दताऽत्मनः ॥ ११ ॥

*If it were totally unmanifest, there would be no supreme love.* If your true nature as Bliss were _completely_ unknown to you, you would not love yourself at all. We only love things we know or experience as good. The fact that you have an instinctive, supreme love for your own existence proves that the Bliss is "shining" at some level.

*If it were totally manifest, there would be no desire for objects*. If your nature as Supreme Bliss were _fully_ and clearly manifest to you right now, you would never crave a cup of coffee, a new car, or external validation. Why? Because if you have the ocean, you don't go looking for a drop of water. Desire  for objects proves that the Bliss is "hidden" at some level.

The author concludes that in our current state of ignorance (अविद्या), the Bliss of the Self is **partially manifest** (allowing us to love ourselves) but **partially hidden** (causing us to seek happiness in external things).


आत्मभाने प्रतिबन्धविचारः 

The discussion about obstacles (Blockages) to the Manifestation of the Self. The student naturally asks: **"If the Self is self-luminous like the sun, what could possibly be strong enough to obstruct it?"**
