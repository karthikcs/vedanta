>[!tip] Tattva Viveka prakaranam
>Chapter on the Discrimination of Reality


## Shloka 1:

### मङ्गलाचरणम् 


नमः श्रीशङ्करानन्दगुरुपादाम्बुजन्मने । 
सविलासमहामोहग्राहग्रासैककर्मणे ॥ १ ॥

Auspicious invocation. Salutations to the lotus feet of the Guru, Sri Shankara, the embodiment of supreme bliss. He who performs the sole act of devouring the great delusion with all its allurements.


## Shloka 2:

तत्पदाम्बुरुहृद्वन्द्वसेवानिर्मलचेतसाम् । 
सुखबोधाय तत्त्वस्य विवेकोऽयं विधीयते ॥ २ ॥

For those whose minds are purified by the service of the feet of such Guru (as said in previous shloka), the knowledge of discrimination will be told in this book. ॥ 2 ॥

We need to understand few points here 
- A pure mind is prerequisite for the knowledge that's going to be told in this text
- Service of the Guru's feet doesn't necessarily mean physical service by rubbing or touching, instead performing Shravanam, mananam and Nidhidyasanam in the supervision of the Guru. 

The author starts with a doubt

If Brahman (ultimate reality) is defined as **Eternal, One, and the very nature of Knowledge itself**, how do we explain the variety of different thoughts we have in our daily lives?

How can we say Knowledge is unbroken, eternal and only one?

One might wonder how we  "knowing a pot" and "knowing a cloth" are not the multiplicity of knowledge. When we can say "I just gained knowledge" there is a birth of knowledge, so how can it be eternal and unbroken? 

The next few phrases explain that these differences are only due to the external objects and the mental states associated with them, not a change in the underlying Consciousness itself.

**ज्ञानस्य नित्यत्व  निरूपणम् ।**

Establishing the fact of permanence and infinity of knowledge.
## Shloka 3:

शब्दस्पर्शादयो वेद्या वैचित्र्याज्जागरे पृथक् । 
ततो विभक्ता तत्संविदैकरूप्यान्न भिद्यते ॥ ३ ॥

**Focusing wakeful state:**

Sound, touch, and other objects of knowledge are distinct in wakefulness due to their diversity. But they are not different from the one consciousness that is their essence. ॥ 3 ॥

> [!tip]- Avastha traya (अवस्था त्रय) - 3 States of consciousness
**Jagrt (जागृत), Swapna (स्वप्न), and Sushupti (सुषुप्ति)** are terms in #vedanta that refer to the three states of consciousness in human experience, waking state, dream state and deep sleep state.

The text argues that while the things we hear, touch, or see are all different from one another, the **act of knowing** them (Awareness) does not change its nature.

#### 1. The Diversity of the Known (वेद्या)

The text lists the things that are "knowable" and distinct:

- **Sensory Objects:** Sound (_Shabda_), Touch (_Sparsha_), etc. These are the objects of the ears and skin.
    
- **The Instruments:** The senses themselves (ears, skin, etc.) and the elements like Space (_Akasha_) that allow them to function.
    
- **The Difference:** In the waking state, these objects are separate (पृथक्) and different (भिन्न) because they have "different natures" . A sound is not a touch; a pot is not a cloth.

#### 2. The Unity of Consciousness (संविद्)

Despite the variety of objects, the text makes a crucial distinction about the **Awareness** (संविद्) of them:

- **Vibhakta (Detached):** Consciousness is "set apart" from the objects. Even though it reveals the objects, it does not become them.
    
- **Na Bhidyate (Does not divide):** The awareness of a sound is the same "awareness" as the awareness of a touch. The _content_ changes, but the _light_ of awareness remains identical.
    
- **Ekarupyat (Uniformity):** The reason Consciousness is one is its **singular nature**. It does not have parts or different "flavors."

## Shloka 4:

जागरे संविदः एकरूपतां निरूप्य स्वप्नेऽप्यतिदिशति । तथैव ।

Having established the oneness of consciousness in wakefulness, it is also explained in dreams. Similarly...

तथा स्वप्नेऽत्र  वेद्यं तु न स्थिरं जागरे स्थिरम् । 
तदभेदोऽतस्तयोस्संविदेकरूपा न भिद्यते ॥ ४ ॥

Similarly, in dreams, the object of knowledge is not stable, nor is it stable in wakefulness. Therefore, the consciousness that is the essence of both is not different. ॥ 4 ॥

This verse highlights the concept that while the experiences in the dream state and the waking state may seem different in terms of stability, the underlying consciousness that experiences both is the same and undivided. The light of consciousness illuminating the dream-mountain is the same light illuminating the waking-mountain.

## Shloka 5:

अनन्तरं सौषुप्तिकसंविदोऽप्येकत्वविवक्षया आदौ तदस्तित्वं साधयति, सुप्तेति ।

Similarly, even in deep sleep, there is no multiplicity in consciousness, which proves its oneness. The wise ones affirm this in the beginning |

We will now focus on the deep sleep state (सुषुप्ति) and aim to establish that even in this state, consciousness is one and undivided. It starts by asserting the existence of the deep sleep state itself.

सुप्तोत्थितस्य सौषुप्तिकतमो बोधो भवेत् स्मृतिः । 
सा चाऽवबुद्धाविषयाऽवबुद्धं तत्तदा तमः ॥ ५ ॥

Upon waking from deep sleep, the ignorance experienced during deep sleep is remembered. This ignorance is recognized as an object by the awakened mind ॥ 5 ॥

The verse emphasizes the continuity of consciousness and memory across different states of being. Even though one may not be actively aware during deep sleep, upon waking, one can recall that state of deep sleep as a period of ignorance. This recollection is possible because the underlying consciousness remains constant, providing a basis for memory and awareness across different states. Also recollection can not happen if object was not experienced. If we are able to recollect the state deep relaxation, that should have been experienced. The entity that experiences everything is the Consciousness (the witness), which is the same entity in all 3 states.

## Shloka 6 & 7:

स बोधो विषयद्धिन्नो न बोधात्छमप्रघोधवत्‌ | 
एव स्थानत्रयेऽप्येका सवित्तददिनान्तरे || ६ ||

मासाब्दथुगकसपेषु गतागतेष्वनेकधा । 
नोदेति नाऽस्तमेत्येका संविदेषा खयम्प्रभा ॥ ७ ||

**Consciousness vs. Objects** The 6th verse argues that the "light" of awareness is separate from the "things" it illuminates. Just as a physical lamp is different from the table or chair it shines upon. Similarly our consciousness is distinct from the thoughts, images, or physical objects it perceives.

**The Consistency of "Knowing"** Author Sri Vidyaranya points out that the consciousness we have while dreaming is the _same_ consciousness we have while awake. The "scenery" changes (from a dream world to a real bedroom), but the "Knowingness" (बोधा) does not change its nature. It doesn't become "dream-flavored" or "waking-flavored"; it remains pure awareness

**Bridging the Gap of Time** The second half of the verse and 7th verse extends this logic to time
- **The Three States:** In waking, dreaming, and deep sleep, the "knower" is the same.
- **Across Days:** The consciousness you have today is identical in essence to the consciousness you had yesterday and the one you will have tomorrow.

**The conclusion**
The consciousness (संविद्) is non-dual and eternal. While our experiences are fragmented (we wake up, we sleep, months pass), the underlying "Screen of Consciousness" is one continuous, unbroken reality. It concludes that because consciousness never "parts" from itself and doesn't change across states or days, it must be the आत्मा —the eternal Self. Because the nature of आत्मा is the same as nature of consciousness

Till now it has been established that consciousness is the same eternal entity, existed all the time, unbroken in all the 3 states. 



**ज्ञानस्य आत्मत्वपरमानन्दत्वनिरूपणम्** 

The demonstration of Knowledge as the Self (आत्मा) and as Supreme Bliss (आनन्द)

## Shloka 8:

इयमात्मा परानन्दः परप्रेमास्पदं  यतः । 
मा न भूव हि भूयासमिति प्रेमात्मनीक्ष्यते  ॥ ८ ॥

We already know Self (आत्मा) is eternal (नित्यम्). If anything is eternal, that should be the Truth as well. One entity that can achieve this is the consciousness (संविद्), as we have already established that it is eternal in the previous phrase. Due to the fact that it is eternal, it should be Truth as well. Because there is no difference (अभिन्नं) between the characteristics of consciousness (संविद्) and Self (आत्मा), we can prove both are same.

It is proven by the universal, instinctive desire: "May I never cease to be, may I exist forever." This reveals that we love our own existence above all else. This isn't just a casual thought; it is a **universal longing**. Even when a person is suffering, the core "I" wants to continue existing. The text argues that we never wish for our own absolute destruction.

So, why do we want to exist forever?
- We only want things to persist if we **love** them or if they bring us **happiness**.
- Since the desire for self-existence is "unconditional" (we want to exist even when we don't have external possessions), it proves that the **Self is the most beloved thing.**

In Advaita philosophy, **Love (प्रेम)** and **Happiness (आनन्द)** are two sides of the same coin:
- You love something because it is a source of joy.
- If you love your "Self" more than anything else (more than wealth, fame, or even your own body), then the "Self" must be the **highest source of joy (Supreme bliss)**.

## Shloka 9:

 तत्प्रेमर्थमन्यत्र नैवमन्यार्थमात्मनः  ।
अतस्तत्परमं तेन परमानन्द्ताऽत्मनः  ॥ ९॥

This verse provides  the argument that you are the source of supreme happiness. It uses a logic of **unconditional vs. conditional love** to prove that the Self (आत्मा) is the highest bliss

Everything in the world is loved for the sake of the Self, but the Self is loved for its own sake and never for the sake of anything else. Therefore, because the Self is the ultimate and absolute object of love, it is proven to be the nature of Supreme Bliss.

The first half explains why we love external things (money, family, health, objects).

- We do not love a bank account for the paper's sake; we love it for the security or pleasure **it gives us**.
- We love our friends and family because they bring **us** joy or fulfill **our** life.
- Logic: All external love is **instrumental** (a means to an end).

This is the "flip side" of the logic.

- Do you love yourself so that you can get a promotion? No. Even if you lose your job, your health, or your money, the core "I" still wants to exist and be happy.
- The love for the Self is **terminal** (the end goal). It is never a "tool" used to achieve something else.

Because the love for the Self is the only love that doesn't depend on a reason or a benefit, it is called **Paramam** (Supreme/Absolute). We can hence state the self is the one which has highest level of bliss for us.


**ज्ञानस्य परब्रह्माभिन्नत्वनिरूपणं** 
The Demonstration of the identity between Knowledge and Supreme Brahman

## Shloka 10:

इत्थम् सच्चित्परानन्द आत्मा युक्त्या तथाविधम्  |
परं ब्रह्मा तयोश्चैक्यं श्रुत्यन्तेषूपदिष्यते ॥ १०॥

Through logical reasoning, the Self is proven to be of the nature of Existence, Consciousness, and Supreme Bliss (सत् चित् आनन्द). The Upanishads have declared that the Supreme Brahman is of the same nature, concluding that the individual Self and the Absolute Brahman are fundamentally one and the same.

The author is emphasizing that this isn't "blind faith." You don't have to believe in a far-off God to understand this. By simply analyzing your own experience—the fact that you exist, that you are aware, and that you love your own life—you can logically conclude that your true nature is **Existence-Consciousness-Bliss.**

**आत्मनः परमानन्दरूपत्वे  विप्रतिपत्तिमशक्या  परिहरति**

After establishing the nature of Self as the same as Brahma, we still have doubt if that is true. Because normally we don't recognize it. We always feel sorrow, we are in pain, we feel limited. Then how can we be the same as brahma. In the upcoming verses this doubt will be addressed


## Shloka 11:

अभाने न परं प्रेम, भाने न विषये श्पृहा । 
अतो भानेऽप्यभाताऽसौ परमानन्दताऽत्मनः ॥ ११ ॥

*If it were totally unmanifest, there would be no supreme love.* If your true nature as Bliss were _completely_ unknown to you, you would not love yourself at all. We only love things we know or experience as good. The fact that you have an instinctive, supreme love for your own existence proves that the Bliss is "shining" at some level.

*If it were totally manifest, there would be no desire for objects*. If your nature as Supreme Bliss were _fully_ and clearly manifest to you right now, you would never crave a cup of coffee, a new car, or external validation. Why? Because if you have the ocean, you don't go looking for a drop of water. Desire  for objects proves that the Bliss is "hidden" at some level.

The author concludes that in our current state of ignorance (अविद्या), the Bliss of the Self is **partially manifest** (allowing us to love ourselves) but **partially hidden** (causing us to seek happiness in external things).


**आत्मभाने प्रतिबन्धविचारः** 

The discussion about obstacles (Blockages) to the Manifestation of the Self. The student naturally asks: **"If the Self is self-luminous like the sun, what could possibly be strong enough to obstruct it?"**
## Shloka 12:

अध्येतृवर्गमध्यस्थपुत्राध्ययनशब्दवत् ।
भानेऽप्यभानं भानस्य प्रतिबन्धेन युज्यते ॥ १२ ॥


This verse uses a brilliant analogy to explain how something can be present and perceived, yet simultaneously unrecognized.

**The Analogy: The Student in the Choir**

Imagine a group of students all chanting the Vedas together in unison. A father is standing nearby. His own son is in that group, chanting loudly.

- **The Perception:** The father hears the sound of his son's voice. It is physically hitting his ears.
- **The Obstacle:** Because all the other students are chanting the same words at the same time, with same pitch, the son's specific voice is "drowned out" or blurred by the collective sound. The father cannot distinguish, "This is my son's specific voice."

## Shloka 13:

प्रतिबन्धोऽस्ति भातीति व्यवहारार्हवस्तुनि ।
तन्निरस्य विरुद्धस्य  तस्योत्पादनमुच्यते ॥ १३॥

It provides a precise definition of what a "blockage" (प्रतिबन्ध) actually does to our consciousness.

The verse explains that the reason you don't feel like a "Supreme Being of Bliss" is because a specific mental obstacle has **dismissed** the truth and **replaced** it with a false, opposite feeling of lack and limitation.

It is like a person who is rich but has amnesia; the amnesia "dismisses" the fact of their wealth and "generates" the false identity of being a beggar


## Shloka 14:

तस्य हेतुः समानाभिहारः पुत्रध्वनिश्रुतौ । 
इहाऽनादिरविद्यैव व्यामोहैकनिबन्धनम् ॥ १४ ॥

This verse explains the **cause** of the obstruction described in the previous verses by revisiting the earlier analogy.

In the example of the father trying to hear his son's voice:

- **The Cause:** "the mixing or overwhelming of similar things." (समानाभिहारः)
- Because the other students are chanting the **same** words with the **same** pitch and rhythm, the individual identity of the son's voice is lost in the crowd. The "commonality" acts as the barrier.

In the case of the Self (_Atman_):

- **The Cause:** The obstacle is Ignorance (अविद्या)
- It is the root reason why we confuse the body with the Self and why we feel we are "not Blissful." and it is beginningless

The verse establishes that:

1. Ignorance is the root cause.
2. It is not a lack of light, but a "mixing" of the Real with the Unreal.


**प्रकृतिस्वरूपनिरूपणम्‌** 

The definition of the character of Primordial Nature (प्रकृति)
## Shloka 15:

चिदानन्दमयब्रह्मप्रतिबिम्बसमन्विता । 
तमोरजस्सत्त्वगुणा प्रकृतिर्द्विविधा च सा ॥ १५ ॥

Prakriti is essentially a "mirror" made of three qualities that catches the reflection of the Absolute brahma. Depending on how clean that mirror is (the quality of Sattva, Rajas and Tamas), it is called either _Maya_ or _Avidya_.

Maya - Is mostly filled with Shuddha chaitanya which is Sattva guna
Avidya - Is mostly with Rajas and Tamas


>[!tip]- Read more about 3 fundamental gunas
>[[Vedanta Notes/General Terms/3 Fundamental Qualities - त्रिगुण\|3 Fundamental Qualities - त्रिगुण]]

In reality, there is only Brahman. But for the sake of explaining the world, we speak of Prakriti. This Prakriti is a reflection-bearing medium. We divide it into two (Maya and Avidya) to explain why there is a God who controls the world and an individual who suffers in it. These are not real divisions in the Truth; they are divisions in the reflection.

>[!tip]- Read more about 2 types of Prakruti
>[[Ignorance.svg]]


Prakriti is split based on the **limitations (उपाधि)** of the Jiva and Ishvara.

- **Maya:** Pure Sattva (The medium for Ishvara/God).
- **Avidya:** Impure Sattva (The medium for Jiva/Individual Soul).
- There is 3rd aspect which is Tamas pradhaana prakruti which is the material cause of the physical world 

Sage Vidyaranya argues Maya and Avidya is sufficient because the world-creating power (Tamas) can be considered a part or an extension of the primary power.


**कारणदारीरनिरूपणम्‌** 

Explanation of causal body 

## Shloka 16:

सत्त्वशुद्ध्यविशुद्धिभ्यां मायाविद्ये च ते मते । 
मायाबिम्बो वशीकृत्य तां स्यात्सर्वज्ञ ईश्वरः ॥ १६ ॥


**The Definitions of Purity and Impurity**

This explains what is meant by the "Cleanness" of the reflected medium:

- **Sattva-Shuddhi (Purity):** Defined as गुणान्तरेण अनभिभवः —a state where the quality of Sattva (light) is **not overwhelmed** by the other two qualities (Rajas and Tamas). It is like a clear, steady flame.
- **Avi-shuddhi (Impurity):** This is described as _Raja-stamobhyam mishranam_—the **mixing** of Sattva with Rajas (activity/passion) and Tamas (dullness/inertia) in varying proportions. This mixing "soils" the mirror.

## Shloka 17:

अविद्यावशगस्त्वन्यस्तद्वैचित्र्यादनेकधा ।
सा कारणशरीरं स्यात्प्राज्ञस्तत्राभिमानवान् ॥ १७ ॥


**The Definition of the Jiva**
The text distinguishes the Jiva from Ishvara (God) based on the medium of reflection:

- **The Medium:** Unlike Ishvara (who reflects in pure Sattva), the Jiva is the reflection of Consciousness in **Malina-Sattva** (Impure Sattva).
- **The Condition:** Because the medium is soiled by Rajas and Tamas, the Jiva is अविद्यावशग—under the control of ignorance.

A common question is: "If Brahman is one, why are there billions of people?"
- **The Logic of Variety (_Vaichitryat_):** The commentary explains that the mixture of Rajas and Tamas is never identical.
- Just as different shades of grey are created by mixing different amounts of black and white, the "impurity" in the Sattva varies in every individual.
- **The Result:** This creates the diverse forms of life—**Deva** (gods/celestial beings), **Manushya** (humans), and **Tiryaga** (animals/plants).

The text defines the "Causal Body," which is the most subtle of the three bodies we possess:
- **Why "Causal"** (कारणशरीरं): It is called the cause because it is the "seed" from which the Gross Body (physical) and Subtle Body (mental) arise.
- **Why "Body" (_Sharira_):** The word _Sharira_ comes from the root meaning "that which perishes" (_Shiryamanatvat_). Even this deep causal ignorance is temporary and will be destroyed by Knowledge.

The commentary introduces a specific name for the Jiva when it is identified with this Causal Body:

- **Prajna (प्राज्ञ):** This is the name of the consciousness in the state of **Deep Sleep** (_Sushupti_).
- **The Logic:** Even though we aren't "thinking" in deep sleep, we have a form of "undifferentiated knowledge" (_Prajna_). We know "nothing," but we are aware of that "nothingness."
- **Comparison:** Just as the Jiva has a Causal Body (Avidya), the text hints that **Maya** is the Causal Body of **Ishvara**.


**लिङ्ग शरीर निरूपणं** 
Demonstration of subtle body
## Shloka 18:

तमःप्रधानप्रकृतेस्तद्भोगायेश्वराज्ञया । 
वियत्पवनतेजोऽम्बुभुवो भूतानि जज्ञिरे ॥ १८ ॥

The text explains that the universe is not created randomly. It is created for the experience (भोग) of the Jivas (referred to here as _Prājñas_). 

- **Definition of Bhoga:** The text defines it as **Sukha-duhkha-anubhavāya** — "the experience of pleasure and pain."
- **The Logic:** Jivas have past karmas. To "reap" the results of those actions, they need a physical environment. Therefore, the world is essentially a "field of experience."

**The Material: "तमःप्रधानप्रकृते"**
This indicates the material cause for the creation of universe is the तमःप्रधानप्रकृतिः 

| **State of Prakriti** | **Dominant Guna**               | **Resulting Entity**          |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| **Māyā**              | Pure Sattva (_Śuddha-sattva_)   | **Īśvara** (God)              |
| **Avidyā**            | Impure Sattva (_Malina-sattva_) | **Jīva** (Individual)         |
| **Tamah-pradhāna**    | Dominant Tamas                  | **Bhūta-Bhautika** (Elements) |

5 Basic elements in subtle form are arose from the same Prakruti

- **Viyat:** Ether (Space)
- **Pavana:** Air
- **Tejas:** Fire
- **Ambu:** Water
- **Bhuvaḥ:** Earth

Creation of sensory capabilities (ज्ञानेन्द्रिय सृष्टि)
## Shloka 19:

सत्त्वांशैः पञ्चभिस्तेषां क्रमाद्धीन्द्रियपञ्चकम् । 
श्रोत्रत्वगक्षिरसनघ्राणाख्यमुपजायते ॥ १९ ॥

The sense organs do not come from nothingness; they are born from the **five elements** (Ether, Air, Fire, Water, and Earth). As we saw in the previous verses, the elements are "Tamasic" (material). However, the commentator emphasizes that it is the **Sattva-portion** of these elements that becomes the senses.

**Why Sattva?** Sattva is light, clarity, and knowledge. Since the job of the senses is to "bring light" or "bring knowledge" about the world to the mind, they must be made of the Sattvic essence of matter.

| **Sense Organ (धीन्द्रिय)**  | **Object it Grasps (ग्राहक)** | **Element of Origin** |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------------- | --------------------- |
| Sense of hearing (श्रोत्र)   | Sound (शब्द)                  | Ether (Viyat)         |
| Sense of touch/feel (त्वक् ) | Touch (स्पर्श )               | Air (Vayu)            |
| Sense of vision (अक्षि )     | Form/Color (रूप )             | Fire (Tejas)          |
| Sense of taste (रसन)         | Taste (रस )                   | Water (Ap)            |
| Sense of smell (घ्राण)       | Smell (गन्ध)                  | Earth (Prithvi)       |

We need keep in mind here that, the organ is not referring to the physical organ like ear, skin, eye, tongue, and nose instead of the internal capability of hearing, feeling, seeing, tasting and smelling. 


Creation of internal organ (अन्तःकरणम्)
## Shloka 20:

तैरन्तःकरणं सर्वैर्वृत्तिभेदेन तद्विधा **।** 
मनो विमर्शरूपं स्याद्बुद्धिः स्यान्निश्चयात्मिका ॥ २० ॥

While the previous verse explained how the _individual_ Sattva-parts of elements create the five senses, this verse explains what happens when the Sattva-parts of **all five elements combine**

The "Internal Instrument" (_Antahkarana_) is a **collective product**.

- The **Mind/Intellect** comes from the **sum total** (_Samashti_) of the Sattva from all five elements (Ether + Air + Fire + Water + Earth). This is why the mind can process sound, touch, sight, taste, and smell all at once.

The text simplifies the internal instrument into two primary functions (modes). As we discussed earlier, although there are often four divisions, here they are merged into two:

**Manas (Mind):** This is the state of "Vimarsha" (wavering or pondering). It is the indecisive faculty that asks "Is it this or is it that?" (_Sankalpa-Vikalpa_). It is the part of you that feels, desires, and reacts

**Buddhi (Intellect):** This is the "Nishchaya" (determining) faculty. It is the part of you that judges, evaluates, and comes to a conclusion: "This is a pot," or "This is my duty."



## Shloka 21:

रजोऽंशैः पञ्चभिस्तेषां क्रमात्कर्मेन्द्रियाणि तु । 
वाक्पाणिपादपायूपस्थाभिधानानि जज्ञिरे ॥ २१ ॥

Just like the senses, these organs are born from the **individual** Rajasic portions of the 5 elements.

Following table gives one on one relationship 

| **Element** | **Nature of the Rajas** | Action Organ (कर्मेन्द्रिय) | **Specific Action**        |
| ----------- | ----------------------- | --------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| **Ether**   | Vibration/Space         | Speech (वाक्)               | Speaking / Expression      |
| **Air**     | Movement/Grasping       | Hands (पाणि)                | Handling / Giving & Taking |
| **Fire**    | Speed/Motion            | Feet (पाद)                  | Walking / Locomotion       |
| **Water**   | Flow/Cleansing          | Anus (पायु)                 | Elimination / Excretion    |
| **Earth**   | Density/Structure       | Genitals (उपस्थ)            | Procreation / Pleasure     |


## Shloka 22:

तैः सर्वैः सहितैः प्राणो वृत्तिभेदात्स पञ्चधा । 
प्राणोऽपानः समानश्चोदानव्यानौ च ते पुनः ॥ २२ ॥

While the organs of action (like hands) come from the _individual_ Rajas-portions of elements, the **Prana** is born from the **combined (total) Rajasic portions** of all five elements (Ether, Air, Fire, Water, and Earth).

- Because it is a "collective" energy, it is capable of sustaining the entire body.
- Just as the mind (Total Sattva) can process all types of knowledge, the Prana (Total Rajas) can power all types of physical movements and biological functions.
 

The life-force is essentially one, but it is named in five ways based on the **direction** and **purpose** of its movement within the body:

| **Name of Prana** | **Function/Direction** | **Physical Location/Role**                           |
| ----------------- | ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **Prāṇa**         | Upward / Outward       | Respiration (located in the heart/nose).             |
| **Apāna**         | Downward               | Excretion and reproduction (waste removal).          |
| **Samāna**        | Central / Balanced     | Digestion and assimilation (in the navel).           |

## Shloka 23:

बुद्धिकर्मेन्द्रियप्राणपञ्चकैर्मनसा धिया ।  
शरीरं सप्तदशभिःसूक्ष्मं तल्लिङ्गमुच्यते ॥ २३ ॥

The verse groups these 17 elements into five categories:

1. **Buddhi-pañcaka (5):** The five organs of perception or knowledge (_Jnana-indriyas_): Ear, Skin, Eye, Tongue, and Nose.
2. **Karmēndriya-pañcaka (5):** The five organs of action: Speech, Hands, Feet, and the organs of excretion and procreation.
3. **Prāṇa-pañcaka (5):** The five vital airs: Prana, Apana, Samana, Udana, and Vyana.
4. **Manas (1):** The doubting or indecisive mind.
5. **Dhī (1):** The determining intellect (_Buddhi_).

**Total:**  $5 + 5 + 5 + 1 + 1 = 17 

Together they are called as लिङ्ग शरीर (Linga shareera)


## Shloka 24:

प्राज्ञस्तत्राभिमानेन तैजसत्वं प्रपद्यते । 
हिरण्यगर्भतामीशस्तयोर्व्यष्टिसमष्टिता ॥ २४ ॥


By identifying with this (subtle body), the _Prajna_ (the soul in the causal state) becomes _Taijasa_ (the luminous one). Similarly, the Lord (_Isha_), by identifying with the collective (subtle body), becomes _Hiranyagarbha_. The difference between the two is that of the individual (_Vyashti_) and the collective (_Samashti_).

- **व्यष्टि (Individual level) :** When the individual soul (_Prajna_), which was previously in the deep-sleep/causal state, identifies with its own 17-part subtle body, it is called **Taijasa** (associated with the dream state).
    
- **समष्टि (Cosmic level) :** When the Supreme Lord (_Ishvara_), previously in the causal state, identifies with the total collective of all subtle bodies in the universe, He is called **Hiranyagarbha** (Cosmic Mind).


## Shloka 25:

समष्टिरीशस्तत्सर्वेषां स्वात्मतादात्म्यवेदनात् । 
तदभावात्ततोऽन्ये तु कथ्यन्ते व्यष्टिसंज्ञया ॥ २५ ॥

This verse explains the psychological and philosophical basis for the distinction between the "Total (Cosmic)" and the "Part (Individual)"

Ishvara (or Hiranyagarbha in this context) is called **Samashti** because He feels identity with all subtle bodies as His own self (_svātma_).

Just as you feel that your hands, feet, and head are all "you" despite being different parts, the Cosmic Mind (Hiranyagarbha) feels that every single mind and body in the universe is His own body. This total, undivided awareness is called **Samashti**


**पञ्चीकरण विवरणम्** 
## Shloka 26:

तद्भोगाय पुनर्भोग्यभोगायतनजन्मने । 
पञ्चीकरोति भगवान् प्रत्येकं वियदादिकम् ॥ २६ ॥

This verse explains the "Why" and "How" behind the creation of the physical, tangible, gross universe.

**The Purpose: "Tad-bhōgāya" (For that enjoyment)**

- **Context:** In the previous verses, we saw the creation of the **Subtle Body** (_Sukshma Sharira_).
- **The Problem:** The subtle body (mind, senses, pranas) needs a physical "field" to actually experience the world and a physical "house" to live in.
- **The Solution:** To provide the means for experience (_bhōgya_) and the location for experience (_bhōgāyatana_—the gross physical body), the Lord initiates the next stage of creation.

**The Process: "Pañcīkarōti" (Quintuplication)**

- The word _Panchikarana_ means "making into five".
- **Bhagavan** (the Lord/Ishvara) takes each of the five subtle elements—starting with **Viyad-adikam** (Ether and the others)—and mixes them together in a specific mathematical proportion.
- Until this mixing happens, the elements are "subtle" (_tanmatras_) and cannot be seen or touched. After _Panchikarana_, they become the "gross" elements (_Mahabhutas_) that form the physical earth, water, fire, air, and space we perceive.


## Shloka 27:

द्विधा विधाय चैकैकं चतुर्धा प्रथमं पुनः ।  
स्वस्वेतरद्वितीयांशैर्योजनात्पञ्च पञ्च ते ॥ २७ ॥

This verse provides the "recipe" used by the Lord (_Bhagavan_) to create physical matter. To make a single **Gross Element** (like Gross Earth), the following steps occur:

The Formula for a Gross Element ($G$):

$$G_{Element} = \frac{1}{2}(\text{Own Subtle Element}) + \frac{1}{8}(\text{Subtle A}) + \frac{1}{8}(\text{Subtle B}) + \frac{1}{8}(\text{Subtle C}) + \frac{1}{8}(\text{Subtle D})$$

| **Gross Element** | **Composition**                                                |     |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- | --- |
| **Gross Earth**   | $50\%$ Subtle Earth + $12.5\%$ each of Space, Air, Fire, Water |     |
| **Gross Water**   | $50\%$ Subtle Water + $12.5\%$ each of Space, Air, Fire, Earth |     |
| **Gross Fire**    | $50\%$ Subtle Fire + $12.5\%$ each of Space, Air, Water, Earth |     |
| **Gross Air**     | $50\%$ Subtle Air + $12.5\%$ each of Space, Fire, Water, Earth |     |
| **Gross Space**   | $50\%$ Subtle Space + $12.5\%$ each of Air, Fire, Water, Earth |     |

This explains why every physical object we touch (like a stone) contains all five elements. We call it "Earth" only because the Earth element is the dominant part ($50\%$) of that mixture.
