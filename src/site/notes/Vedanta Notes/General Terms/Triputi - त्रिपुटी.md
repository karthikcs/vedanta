Let's now understand the concept of Triputi.

In Vedanta, particularly in Advaita Vedanta, Triputi (त्रिपुटी) refers to the triad of:
 * ज्ञाता (jñātṛ): The knower, the subject, the individual consciousness (Atman or Jiva).
 * ज्ञान (jñāna): The knowledge, the process of knowing, the cognition.
 * ज्ञेय (jñeya): The known, the object of knowledge, the world or phenomenon.
This triad is fundamental to all cognitive experiences. Every act of knowing involves a knower, the process of knowing, and the object that is known.
Significance in Advaita Vedanta:
Advaita Vedanta, which emphasizes the non-dual nature of reality, uses the concept of Triputi to illustrate the illusory nature of duality. It posits that ultimately, only the Atman (the Self) is real, and the distinction between the knower, the known, and the process of knowing is an illusion superimposed on the единое (Brahman).
In the state of Self-realization, this Triputi dissolves, revealing the underlying oneness of reality. There is no separate knower or known, only the pure consciousness that is the Atman.

## Analogy:
Imagine a lamp (ज्ञान) illuminating an object (ज्ञेय) in a room. You (ज्ञाता) perceive the object because of the light. In this scenario, you, the lamp, and the object are distinct entities. However, in Advaita Vedanta, the ultimate reality is like a room where everything, including you, the lamp, and the object, are made of the same light. There is no real distinction between them.


## Key Points:
 * Triputi is a fundamental concept in Vedanta, representing the triad of knower, knowledge, and known.
 * Advaita Vedanta uses this concept to highlight the illusory nature of duality and the ultimate oneness of reality.
 * In Self-realization, the Triputi dissolves, revealing the non-dual nature of the Atman.
Understanding Triputi is crucial for grasping the core principles of Advaita Vedanta and its teachings on the nature of reality and the Self.
