This refers to the six changes or modifications that all entities in the material world undergo. These changes are inherent to the nature of things and are constantly occurring.

Here are the six modifications:
 * जायते (jāyate): Birth or origination. This refers to the coming into existence of an entity, its initial appearance.
 * अस्ति (asti): Existence or being. This is the state of an entity after it has come into existence, its continued presence.
 * वर्धते (vardhate): Growth or development. This refers to the increase in size, complexity, or other qualities of an entity.
 * विपरिणमते (vipariṇamate): Transformation or change. This is the alteration of an entity's form or qualities, a shift in its state.
 * अपक्षीयते (apakṣīyate): Decline or decay. This refers to the gradual decrease in an entity's qualities, its deterioration.
 * विनश्यति (vinaśyati): Destruction or death. This is the complete cessation of an entity's existence, its final disappearance.

These six modifications are a cycle that all material entities go through, from their birth to their eventual destruction. This concept is important in understanding the impermanent nature of the material world and the cyclical nature of time
