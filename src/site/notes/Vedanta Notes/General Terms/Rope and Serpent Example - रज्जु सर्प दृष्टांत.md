## Anecdote (दृष्टांत)

In a semi dark condition, a person was going on a country side and he could see something is lying on the path. It was looking like a serpent (सर्प). Instantly he was afraid and not sure how will reach his destination. He started shivering and sweating due to the sudden appearance of the possible poisonous serpent. At that time, someone came with a light, and this person could see the path better and realized that it was not a serpent, instead it was just a rope. On that very moment the person is relieved and all his fear went off.
