## Satyam Jnanam and Anantam - सत्यं, ज्ञानम्, आनंतम्

1. Satyam (सत्यं) - Something which stays true in all the time frames - past, present and future
2. Knowledge (ज्ञानम्) - Pure knowledge and consciousness 
3. Endless (आनंतम्) - No beginning and no end 

## Eternal

**Proof of eternity for consciousness** (अनादि and अनंत). Let us perform a thought exercise about something which is born. We say something is born if someone witness or experience it. e.g. *I saw the ignition of the wood, so I could see fire was born*. I can also *cognize the putting off the fire*. Likewise we can say anything that starts or dies can be cognized with consciousness. Let us apply this analysis to consciousness. Let us presume the birth of consciousness A was cognized on consciousness B. Then who cognized the birth of B. This initiates the fallacy of infinite regress (अनवस्था दोष). So the initial presumption of consciousness A was cognized on consciousness B was incorrect. Hence we can prove that there is no beginning for consciousness. In the same way we can prove for the end of consciousness as well.

## Continuous 

No break based on Physical space (देश), Time (काल) and Objects (वस्तु) तः  अपरिछिन्नम् 

**Proof of continuity for consciousness by space:** देशतः अपरिछिन्नम्
Normally, an object is limited by space; if a table is "here," it cannot be "there." It has a boundary.
Consciousness is **All-pervading** (_Sarvagata_) and it is not in "space", rather, space itself is an appearance _within_ Consciousness

Let us try to understand it more deeper. Any entity is limited by space will have a container or a cause. e.g. The milk in a glass is limited by glass, where glass as the container. So, the milk is inside the glass but not outside. If you want to go further, glass is on the table, table is in the house, house built on earth and earth is in the space. 

Can we apply the same for consciousness? What holds consciousness? It can not be space, as space itself is appearance within consciousness. So, can it be another "bigger" consciousness? If so what hold "bigger" consciousness. This will again fall into fallacy of infinite regress. Hence we can come to conclusion that consciousness is All pervading. 

**Proof of continuity for consciousness by time** कालतः अपरिछिन्नम् 
We have already seen in the [[Vedanta Notes/General Terms/Characteristics of Brahma#Eternal\|#Eternal]] section how consciousness is beyond time

**Proof of continuity for consciousness by objects** वस्तुतः अपरिछिन्नम् 
This is the most subtle limit. Usually, "A is not B." A chair is not a table. The existence of a second thing which is different from first thing limits the first thing as a "separate" entity. For two things to be "two," there must be a **difference** (बेध) between them. 

Now it us take 2 cases. 
	1. Taking 2 entities as 2 consciousnesses 
	2. Taking consciousness and a non-consciousness

_Case 1_:

Let us assume there could be existence of 2 sentient entities. Like 2 consciousnesses and try to prove they are separate objects

- If Consciousness A and Consciousness B are identical in every quality (both are pure, self-luminous, and formless), there is no logical basis to call them "two."
    
- In logic, if there is no distinguishing mark (_Lakshana_), there is no plurality. Since pure Consciousness has no qualities (attributes like color, size, or personality belong to the _mind_, not the consciousness), two "pure consciousnesses" would effectively be the same one.

The Argument from Objectification (द्रिग् दृश्य विवेक )
To say there is a "second" consciousness, the first consciousness must be aware of it.

- **If you are aware of the second consciousness:** It becomes an **object** of your perception (_Drishya_). In Vedanta, anything that can be observed is "inert" (_Jada_) and limited. Thus, the "second consciousness" you found isn't consciousness at all—it's just a thought or an object in your field of awareness.
    
- **If you are NOT aware of the second consciousness:** Its existence can never be proven. To assert the existence of something that is never known is a logical fallacy.

*Case 2*

Now let us try to create separation from consciousness (चित्) and non-consciousness (जड), as final and absolute boundary.  

Here is the logical proof for why **Consciousness** and **Non-Consciousness** cannot be truly "different" in an absolute sense:


> **Proof 1:**  The "Relationship" Problem (सम्बन्ध अनुपपत्ति)

If two things are fundamentally different (like Consciousness and a rock), there must be a **relationship** that connects them so that Consciousness can "know" the rock.

- **Logical Dilemma:** Does this relationship belong to Consciousness or the rock?
    
    - If it belongs to **Consciousness**, then Consciousness has changed or gained an attribute, which contradicts the proof that pure awareness is unchanging.
        
    - If it belongs to the **rock**, the rock remains inert and cannot "reach out" to Consciousness.
        
- **Conclusion:** Since no logical relationship (_Samyoga_ or _Samavaya_) can exist between a sentient subject and an inert object, the "difference" between them cannot be real. They must be two aspects of the same reality, where the object is merely an appearance in the subject.

>**Proof 2:** The Argument from Borrowed Existence

- Everything that is "Non-Conscious" (जड) still has **Existence** (सत्). You say, "The pot _is_."
    
- In Vedanta, **Existence is Consciousness**. If the pot has "Existence," it is borrowing that existence from the only thing that is self-existent: which is Consciousness.
    
- Just as a "gold ring" is not different from "gold," a "conscious pot" (a pot that exists and is known) is not different from the Consciousness that lends it existence. The "pot-ness" is just a name and form (नाम रूप), not a separate substance.

So we can establish that Consciousness is continuous by object-wise as well.
