## Instrumental (निमित्त) and Material (उपादान) causes (कारणं)

These are two important concepts in #vedanta philosophy. They refer to different types of causes involved in the creation of an effect.

### Instrumental (निमित्त) cause

- **Meaning:** Instrumental cause or efficient cause.
- **Explanation:** It's the immediate, triggering factor that brings about an effect.
- **Example:** A potter's hand and other instruments shaping the clay is the instrumental cause for the pot.

### Material (उपादान) cause

- **Meaning:** Material cause or substantial cause.
- **Explanation:** It's the primary substance from which something is produced.
- **Example:** The clay itself is the instrumental cause for the pot.

**In essence:**

- **Instrumental (निमित्त)** is the "how" of the creation.
- **Material (उपादान)** is the "what" of the creation.

Both are necessary for the creation of an effect.
