## Mind (मनस)

- Deals with desires, emotions, and sensory perceptions.
- The fluctuating part of the internal organ.
## Intellect (बुद्धि)

- Responsible for discrimination, decision-making, and understanding.
- The rational part of the mind.

## Ego (अहंकार)

- The sense of "I" or "me".
- Related to identity and individuality.

## Consciousness (चित्त)

- The pure, infinite aspect of the mind.
- The foundation for the other three components.

The above components are explained in difference only for clarity, but there are NO 4 components. It's only ONE organ, which takes different form as needed. Similar to a mobile phone can become a calling device, a camera, a music player and a data storage as necessary but the device itself is one. 

In some Advaita texts like Vedanta Panchadashi, only 2 types of internal organ (अन्तःकरणम्) is told Mind and Intellect instead of 4. It takes different forms based on it's functions (वृत्तिबेध). 

| **Name of Vritti**     | **Function**         | **Description**                                                                                                                      |
| ---------------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Mind (मनस)**         | **Sankalpa-Vikalpa** | The "doubting" mode. It is the indecisive state that asks, "Should I do this or that?" It processes sensory input.                   |
| **Intellect (बुद्धि)** | **Nishchaya**        | The "deciding" mode. It is the faculty of judgment, reasoning, and determination that says, "This is a pot," or "This is the truth." |
| **Memory (चित्त)**     | **Chintana**         | The "recollecting" mode. It is the storehouse of past impressions (_Vasanas_) and the sub-conscious mind that recalls data.          |
| **Ego (अहंकार)**       | **Abhimana**         | The "arrogating" mode. It is the function that attaches the "I" to an action, saying "I am the doer" or "I am happy."                |

Some Vedanti merge internal organ as Manas group and Buddhi group. 

Manas group: **Manas** and **Chitta** are merged.
Buddhi group: **Buddhi** and **Ahamkara** are merged.
