## Mind (मनस)

- Deals with desires, emotions, and sensory perceptions.
- The fluctuating part of the internal organ.
## Intellect (बुद्धि)

- Responsible for discrimination, decision-making, and understanding.
- The rational part of the mind.

## Ego (अहंकार)

- The sense of "I" or "me".
- Related to identity and individuality.

## Consciousness (चित्त)

- The pure, infinite aspect of the mind.
- The foundation for the other three components.

The above components are explained in difference only for clarity, but there are NO 4 components. It's only ONE organ, which takes different form as needed. Similar to a mobile phone can become a calling device, a camera, a music player and a data storage as necessary but the device itself is one.
