There are 4 fold purposes of human life, which is referred in most of the texts both in #Veda and #Vedanta. 

## Dharma - धर्म 

## Artha - अर्थ 

## Kaama - काम 

## Moksha - मोक्ष 


Out of these, #Moksha is the greatest purpose any man can aim for in the life. It is called as परम पुरुषार्थ. Because it is only thing which is permanent (नित्यम् ), other 3 are temporary. Yes even dharma is temporary
