There are 4 fold purposes of human life, which is referred in most of the texts both in #Veda and #Vedanta. 

## Dharma - धर्म 
Performing virtuous deeds, as prescribed by his/her ancestors.  

## Artha - अर्थ 
Accumulation of wealth in this world. Such as gold, money, land and other physical holdings. 

## Kaama - काम 
Enjoying the earthly pleasures. Mostly enjoyed by our sensory organs. Such as seeing beautiful things, eating tasty food, indulging in sensual pleasures etc.

## Moksha - मोक्ष 
Liberation from the cycle of life and death. 

Out of these, #Moksha is the greatest purpose any man can aim for in the life. It is called as परम पुरुषार्थ. Because it is only thing which is permanent (नित्यम् ), other 3 are temporary. Yes even dharma is temporary.
