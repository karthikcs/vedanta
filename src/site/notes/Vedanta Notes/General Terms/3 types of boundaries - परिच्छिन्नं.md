There are 3 types of boundaries that are explained in Vedanta. 

## Boundary by time - कालतः परिच्छिन्नं

This can be translated as "limited by time" or "bounded by time." It is used to describe things that are temporary, transient, or subject to change and decay. 


## Bounded or limited by space - देशतः परिच्छिन्नं

This phrase used in Vedanta philosophy, meaning "limited by space" or "bounded by space."  It describes the finite nature of things within the phenomenal world, contrasting them with the infinite and all-pervading nature of Brahman.

## Bounded or seperated in mind by objects -  वस्तुतः परिच्छिन्नं 

In Vedanta philosophy, "vastutah paricchinnam" (वस्तुतः परिच्छिन्नं) translates to "limited by other objects" or "limited by things." It's a key concept in understanding the nature of reality and the illusion of separateness.
