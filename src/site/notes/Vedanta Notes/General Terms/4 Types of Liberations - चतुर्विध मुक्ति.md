In **Advaita Vedanta**, these four terms refer to different types of **मुक्ति  (liberation)** or **states of union with the divine**, especially in **Vaishnava traditions**. While **Advaita** emphasizes **Jivanmukti (liberation while living)** and **Kaivalya (absolute non-dual realization)**। 

1. **सालोक्यम् (Sālokyam)** – _Residing in the same world as the deity_
    
    - This refers to attaining **heavenly realms** (like Vaikuntha or Kailasa) where the **divine presence** exists. The liberated soul enjoys **being in the same abode** as the personal form of God.
    - The way to attain this is चर्या . Which is to perform service (कैंकर्य ) to God as a servant  (दास)
    - 
    
2. **सामीप्यम् (Sāmīpyam)** – _Being in close proximity to the deity_
    
    - This is **nearness** to the divine, symbolizing **closeness in presence** or **intimate association** with God. The soul remains **in the presence** of the divine eternally.
    - The way to obtain this is by क्रिय, actions as prescribed by Veda, like performing pooja etc
    
3. **सारूप्यम् (Sārūpyam)** – _Attaining the form of the deity_
    
    - Here, the liberated being acquires **a form similar** to that of the deity, reflecting the divine attributes (like radiance or purity), while still maintaining **a subtle distinction**.
    - The way to obtain this is by योग , as explained by Yoga Shastra by Patanjali including Yama, Niyama etc
    
4. **सायुज्यम् (Sāyujyam)** – _Complete union with the deity_
    
    - This is **the closest state of oneness**, where the soul is **merged** with the divine, losing its **individual identity**. In **Advaita Vedanta**, this aligns with **Aikya** or **Brahma-sākshātkāra**—**realizing non-duality** where the **Jīvātman** (individual self) and **Paramātman** (supreme self) are recognized as **one and the same**.
    - The way to obtain this is by obtaining ब्रह्मज्ञानम् , as explained by Advaitha Vedanta. 
    - The experience of oneness among jeeva and brahma is ज्ञानम् 

### **In Advaita Vedanta Context**:

While these four types of liberation are more prevalent in **dualistic** (Dvaita) or **qualified non-dualistic** (Vishishtadvaita) systems, **Advaita** emphasizes the **ultimate liberation (Moksha)** as the **realization of one's identity with Brahman**, beyond all forms and distinctions. **Sāyujyam** aligns closest with **Advaita’s** concept of **absolute oneness** (Advaita Anubhava).
