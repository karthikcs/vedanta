### The "Light" Analogy

To understand this passage, imagine a **flashlight** in a dark room:

1. You shine it on a **book** (Object A).
    
2. You shine it on a **chair** (Object B).
    
3. The book and the chair are different. However, the **light** hitting the book is the exact same quality of light hitting the chair.
    

The passage is saying that **Brahman** is that Light. The objects of the waking world change and are many, but the Awareness that observes them is **One and Constant**.
