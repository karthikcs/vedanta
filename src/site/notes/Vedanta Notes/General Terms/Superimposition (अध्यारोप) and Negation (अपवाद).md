That #Brahma can be known only by the process of Superimposition (अध्यारोप) and Negation (अपवाद ) process. 

- **Adhyaropa** refers to the process of superimposition or attribution of qualities that do not inherently belong to something.
- **Apavada** refers to the process of negation or exclusion, removing something that was previously superimposed.

This will be more clear with an example. Please see below #Illustration

| Adhyaropa | Superimposition | We superimpose the quality of "blueness" on the sky, even though the sky itself has no color. The blueness is due to the interaction of sunlight with the atmosphere. |
| Apavada   | Negation        | Recognizing that the blueness is not inherent to the sky and negating that quality.                                                                                   |
