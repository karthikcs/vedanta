## Sattva (सत्त्व)

**Sattva** is one of the three fundamental qualities (गुण) in #vedanta  philosophy, along with Rajas and Tamas. It represents **knowledge-seeking**, **goodness, purity, balance, and harmony**.

People with a predominance of Sattva are generally:

- Calm and peaceful
- Knowledge-seeking
- Virtuous

Sattva is often associated with positive qualities and is considered to be the most desirable of the three gunas.

## Rajas (रजस)

**Rajas** represents the quality of **passion, activity, and movement**. It is associated with:

- Desire
- Anger
- Greed
- Attachment
- Ego
- Impulsiveness

Individuals with a predominance of Rajas tend to be:

- Energetic
- Ambitious
- Restless
- Competitive

## Tamas (तमस)

**Tamas** represents the quality of **inertia, ignorance, darkness, and delusion**. 

It is associated with:
- Laziness
